1. **Understand the data structure and metrics**: 
   - File 1: `01 Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx` - Likely contains data related to call center performance (e.g., call volumes, response times, customer satisfaction).
   - File 2: `02 Churn-Dataset.xlsx` - Probably includes information about customer churn (e.g., customer demographics, churn status, reasons for churn).
   - File 3: `03 Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx` - Might have details on workforce diversity and inclusion (e.g., employee demographics, inclusion metrics).

2. **Define Key Metrics and Visuals**:
   - For each dataset, we can create relevant KPIs and visualizations. For instance:
     - **Call Center Dataset**: Total calls, average response time, customer satisfaction trends.
     - **Churn Dataset**: Churn rate, customer demographics, retention metrics.
     - **Diversity and Inclusion Dataset**: Gender distribution, representation by role, diversity trends.

3. **Connect Data to Power BI**:
   - I'll provide sample visuals and a dashboard layout suggestion.
   - You can import the datasets into Power BI and build the visuals.

Let me first inspect the datasets to understand the fields and propose an outline.

### Data Overview
